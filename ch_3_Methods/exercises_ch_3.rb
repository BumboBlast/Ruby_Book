#  (1)  Write a program that prints a greeting message. This program should contain a method called greeting that takes a name as its parameter and returns a string.

#  (2)  What do the following expressions evaluate to?
        # 1. x is set to two
        # 2. nil (puts returns nil)
        # 3. "Joe" is printed to the screen (and returned as a value)
        # 4. "four" is set to four
        # 5. nil (print returns nil)
        
#  (3)  Write a program that includes a method called multiply that takes two arguments and returns the product of the two numbers.

#  (4)  What will the following code print to the screen?
        # will not print anything (because the explicit return statement dose not have anything)
        
#  (5)  1) Edit the method definition in exercise #4 so that it does print words on the screen.
#       2) What does it return now?
        # I remove the "return", and now it prints words, but the method itself does not return anything, as the last expression returns nil

#  (6)  What does the following error message tell you?
        # the method expected 2 arguments, and only found 1.
