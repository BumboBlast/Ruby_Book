#  (1)  Write a program called name.rb that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.

#  (2)  Write a program called age.rb that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years.

#  (3)  Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 times. You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. 
#       Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly.

#  (4)  Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, 
#       and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.

#  (5)  Look at the following programs...  What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?
        
        #first case, 3 will be printed to the screen
        #second case, error
