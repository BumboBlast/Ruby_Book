#  (1)  What does the each method in the following program return after it is finished executing?
        # first guess: for loops in ruby reutrn an array of values, and each loops in ruby probably call a for loop in C (which are just funny while loops)
        # therefore, idk
        # Answer: returns the array of values (probably because each loops are similar to for loops in ruby)
        
#  (2)  Write a while loop that takes input from the user, performs an action, and only stops when the user types "STOP". Each loop can get info from the user.
#  (3)  Write a method that counts down to zero using recursion.
